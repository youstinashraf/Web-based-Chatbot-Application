Web-based Chatbot Application

Objective: This project is a web-based chatbot application built using Flask and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The chatbot leverages the facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill model to generate conversational responses.

Technologies Used Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python that is used to create the web application.

Flask-CORS: A Flask extension that handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the web app to accept requests from different origins.

Hugging Face Transformers: A library that provides pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks. In this project, the facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill model is used.

JSON: A lightweight data interchange format used to handle data exchange between the client and server.
